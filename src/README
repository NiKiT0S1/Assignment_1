LABORATORY 1:
"Function and Recursion"

#INTRODUCTION:

This self-laboratory work contains Java methods that solve various algorithmic problems.
Each problem is implemented as a separate method in the Main class.
This README provides instructions for interacting with the code,
including building, testing, and running the Java program.

#REQUIREMENTS:

To compile and run the Java program,
you need to have the following software installed on your system:

1) Java Development Kit (JDK);
2) Terminal or Command Prompt for running commands

#INSTALLATION:

Follow these steps to install and set up the project:

1) Clone the repository:

"git clone <repository-url>"


2) Navigate to the project directory:

"cd java-algorithmic-problems"


3) Compile the Java files:

"javac Main.java"

#USAGE:

After installing the project, follow these steps to run the Java program:

1) Run the compiled Java program:

"java Main"


2) Follow the prompts to select a problem number
and input any required parameters.

#LIST OF PROBLEMS:

The project includes implementations for the following algorithmic problems:

1) Finding the minimum number in an array
2) Calculating the average value of an array
3) Checking if a number is prime
4) Calculating the factorial of a number
5) Finding the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence
6) Calculating the power of a number
7) Reversing an array recursively
8) Checking if a string consists of only digits
9) Finding the binomial coefficient
10) Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers

Each problem is implemented as a separate method in the Main class.
